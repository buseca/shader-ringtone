# Shader ringtones
Ringtones for work-life balance

###Abstract
**Shader is a special ringtone which automatically induces your computer’s sleeping mode**, forcing you to stop the momentum and to be aware of what’s going on around. It helps you to clearly define your life’s priority, like your family or friends, and it makes them sure you answer the phone when they call you on the phone.

###Preface
As web workers, everyday we spend a lot of time on the laptop screen, it captures and exploits the majority of our attention and efforts. Hour after hour, the range of vision becomes conical and other imputs tent to vanish; the daily work’s pressure doesn’t help: it changes priorities and perspectives, making them basically wrong.
To be able to take breaks is fundamental to reach a work-life balance, to improve our life and our mental status. 

To do so, we can organize our own work in an efficient and balanced way, planning activities and breaks too, using time management framework like the Eisenhower Matrix or the Pomodoro Technique. But plans rarely work as they are expected to do, the momentum is hard to stop and fallbacks are often needed. Here comes Shader ringtone.
